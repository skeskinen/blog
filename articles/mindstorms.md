Mindstorms is a 1980 book by Seymour Papert, founder of the Learning Research Group at MIT Media Lab. The main topics are programming and math education and genetic epistemology, theory of learning established by Paperts mentor, Jean Piaget.
Pdf of the 1st edition is available online at Bret Victors website [worrydream.com](http://worrydream.com/refs/Papert%20-%20Mindstorms%201st%20ed.pdf).

4/5, a worthwhile read for anyone interested in knowledge or learning. It gave me a lot more concrete understanding of Piaget's theories in a package that is much closer to my interests than Piaget's own writing.
